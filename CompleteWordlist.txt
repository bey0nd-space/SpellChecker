nellie
felt
that
she
was
uttering
a
false
and
undeserved
insult
but
for
her
husband
s
sake
she
was
capable
of
forgetting
logic
tact
sympathy
for
others
in
reply
to
her
threats
the
doctor
greedily
gulped
a
glass
of
cold
water
nellie
fell
to
entreating
and
imploring
like
the
very
lowest
beggar
at
last
the
doctor
gave
way
he
slowly
got
up
puffing
and
panting
looking
for
his
coat
here
it
is
cried
nellie
helping
him

put
it
on

shall
be
grateful
to
you
but
what
agony
after
putting
on
his
coat
the
doctor
lay
down
again
nellie
got
him
up
and
dragged
him
to
the
hall
then
there
was
an
agonizing
to
do
over
his
goloshes
his
overcoat
his
cap
was
lost
but
at
last
nellie
was
in
the
carriage
with
the
doctor
now
they
had
only
to
drive
thirty
miles
and
her
husband
would
have
a
doctor
s
help
the
earth
was
wrapped
in
darkness
one
could
not
see
one
s
hand
before
one
s
face
a
cold
winter
wind
was
blowing
there
were
frozen
lumps
under
their
wheels
the
coachman
was
continually
stopping
and
wondering
which
road
to
take
nellie
and
the
doctor
sat
silent
all
the
way
it
was
fearfully
jolting
but
they
felt
neither
the
cold
nor
the
jolts
get
on
get
on
nellie
implored
the
driver
at
five
in
the
morning
the
exhausted
horses
drove
into
the
yard
nellie
saw
the
familiar
gates
the
well
with
the
crane
the
long
row
of
stables
and
barns
at
last
she
was
at
home
wait
a
moment
i
will
be
back
directly
she
said
to
stepan
lukitch
making
him
sit
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
dining
room
sit
still
and
wait
a
little
and
i
ll
see
how
he
is
going
on
on
her
return
from
her
husband
nellie
found
the
doctor
lying
down
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
and
muttering
doctor
please
doctor
eh
ask
domna
muttered
stepan
lukitch
what
they
said
at
the
meeting
vlassov
said
who
what
and
to
her
horror
nellie
saw
that
the
doctor
was
as
delirious
as
her
husband
what
was
to
be
done
i
must
go
for
the
zemstvo
doctor
she
decided
then
again
there
followed
darkness
a
cutting
cold
wind
lumps
of
frozen
earth
she
was
suffering
in
body
and
in
soul
and
delusive
nature
has
no
arts
no
deceptions
to
compensate
these
sufferings
then
she
saw
against
the
grey
background
how
her
husband
every
spring
was
in
straits
for
money
to
pay
the
interest
for
the
mortgage
to
the
bank
he
could
not
sleep
she
could
not
sleep
and
both
racked
their
brains
till
their
heads
ached
thinking
how
to
avoid
being
visited
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
she
saw
her
children
the
everlasting
apprehension
of
colds
scarlet
fever
diphtheria
bad
marks
at
school
separation
out
of
a
brood
of
five
or
six
one
was
sure
to
die
the
grey
background
was
not
untouched
by
death
that
might
well
be
a
husband
and
wife
cannot
die
simultaneously
whatever
happened
one
must
bury
the
other
and
nellie
saw
her
husband
dying
this
terrible
event
presented
itself
to
her
in
every
detail
she
saw
the
coffin
the
candles
the
deacon
and
even
the
footmarks
in
the
hall
made
by
the
undertaker
why
is
it
what
is
it
for
she
asked
looking
blankly
at
her
husband
s
face
and
all
the
previous
life
with
her
husband
seemed
to
her
a
stupid
prelude
to
this
something
fell
from
nellie
s
hand
and
knocked
on
the
floor
she
started
jumped
up
and
opened
her
eyes
wide
one
looking
glass
she
saw
lying
at
her
feet
the
other
was
standing
as
before
on
the
table
she
looked
into
the
looking
glass
and
saw
a
pale
tear
stained
face
there
was
no
grey
background
now
i
have
fallen
asleep
she
thought
with
a
sigh
of
relief
the
widow
of
paolo
saverini
lived
alone
with
her
son
in
a
poor
little
house
on
the
outskirts
of
bonifacio
the
town
built
on
an
outjutting
part
of
the
mountain
in
places
even
overhanging
the
sea
looks
across
the
straits
full
of
sandbanks
towards
the
southernmost
coast
of
sardinia
beneath
it
on
the
other
side
and
almost
surrounding
it
is
a
cleft
in
the
cliff
like
an
immense
corridor
which
serves
as
a
harbor
and
along
it
the
little
italian
and
sardinian
fishing
boats
come
by
a
circuitous
route
between
precipitous
cliffs
as
far
as
the
first
houses
and
every
two
weeks
the
old
wheezy
steamer
which
makes
the
trip
to
ajaccio
on
the
white
mountain
the
houses
massed
together
makes
an
even
whiter
spot
they
look
like
the
nests
of
wild
birds
clinging
to
this
peak
overlooking
this
terrible
passage
where
vessels
rarely
venture
the
wind
which
blows
uninterruptedly
has
swept
bare
the
forbidding
coast
it
drives
through
the
narrow
straits
and
lays
waste
both
sides
the
pale
streaks
of
foam
clinging
to
the
black
rocks
whose
countless
peaks
rise
up
out
of
the
water
look
like
bits
of
rag
floating
and
drifting
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
house
of
widow
saverini
clinging
to
the
very
edge
of
the
precipice
looks
out
through
its
three
windows
over
this
wild
and
desolate
picture
she
lived
there
alone
with
her
son
antonia
and
their
dog
semillante
a
big
thin
beast
with
a
long
rough
coat
of
the
sheep
dog
breed
the
young
man
took
her
with
him
when
out
hunting
one
night
after
some
kind
of
a
quarrel
antoine
saverini
was
treacherously
stabbed
by
nicolas
ravolati
who
escaped
the
same
evening
to
sardinia
when
the
old
mother
received
the
body
of
her
child
which
the
neighbors
had
brought
back
to
her
she
did
not
cry
but
she
stayed
there
for
a
long
time
motionless
watching
him
then
stretching
her
wrinkled
hand
over
the
body
she
promised
him
a
vendetta
she
did
not
wish
anybody
near
her
and
she
shut
herself
up
beside
the
body
with
the
dog
which
howled
continuously
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
her
head
stretched
towards
her
master
and
her
tail
between
her
legs
she
did
not
move
any
more
than
did
the
mother
who
now
leaning
over
the
body
with
a
blank
stare
was
weeping
silently
and
watching
it
the
young
man
lying
on
his
back
dressed
in
his
jacket
of
coarse
cloth
torn
at
the
chest
seemed
to
be
asleep
but
he
had
blood
all
over
him
on
his
shirt
which
had
been
torn
off
in
order
to
administer
the
first
aid
on
his
vest
on
his
trousers
on
his
face
on
his
hands
clots
of
blood
had
hardened
in
his
beard
and
in
his
hair
his
old
mother
began
to
talk
to
him
at
the
sound
of
this
voice
the
dog
quieted
down
never
fear
my
boy
my
little
baby
you
shall
be
avenged
sleep
sleep
you
shall
be
avenged
do
you
hear
it
s
your
mother
s
promise
and
she
always
keeps
her
word
your
mother
does
you
know
she
does
slowly
she
leaned
over
him
pressing
her
cold
lips
to
his
dead
ones
then
semillante
began
to
howl
again
with
a
long
monotonous
penetrating
horrible
howl
the
two
of
them
the
woman
and
the
dog
remained
there
until
morning
antoine
saverini
was
buried
the
next
day
and
soon
his
name
ceased
to
be
mentioned
in
bonifacio
he
had
neither
brothers
nor
cousins
no
man
was
there
to
carry
on
the
vendetta
his
mother
the
old
woman
alone
pondered
over
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
straits
she
saw
from
morning
until
night
a
little
white
speck
on
the
coast
it
was
the
little
sardinian
village
longosardo
where
corsican
criminals
take
refuge
when
they
are
too
closely
pursued
they
compose
almost
the
entire
population
of
this
hamlet
opposite
their
native
island
awaiting
the
time
to
return
to
go
back
to
the
maquis
she
knew
that
nicolas
ravolati
had
sought
refuge
in
this
village
all
alone
all
day
long
seated
at
her
window
she
was
looking
over
there
and
thinking
of
revenge
how
could
she
do
anything
without
help
she
an
invalid
and
so
near
death
but
she
had
promised
she
had
sworn
on
the
body
she
could
not
forget
she
could
not
wait
what
could
she
do
she
no
longer
slept
at
night
she
had
neither
rest
nor
peace
of
mind
she
thought
persistently
the
dog
dozing
at
her
feet
would
sometimes
lift
her
head
and
howl
since
her
master
s
death
she
often
howled
thus
as
though
she
were
calling
him
as
though
her
beast
s
soul
inconsolable
too
had
also
retained
a
recollection
that
nothing
could
wipe
out
one
night
as
semillante
began
to
howl
the
mother
suddenly
got
hold
of
an
idea
a
savage
vindictive
fierce
idea
she
thought
it
over
until
morning
then
having
arisen
at
daybreak
she
went
to
church
she
prayed
prostrate
on
the
floor
begging
the
lord
to
help
her
to
support
her
to
give
to
her
poor
broken
down
body
the
strength
which
she
needed
in
order
to
avenge
her
son
she
returned
home
in
her
yard
she
had
an
old
barrel
which
acted
as
a
cistern
she
turned
it
over
emptied
it
made
it
fast
to
the
ground
with
sticks
and
stones
then
she
chained
semillante
to
this
improvised
kennel
and
went
into
the
house
she
walked
ceaselessly
now
her
eyes
always
fixed
on
the
distant
coast
of
sardinia
he
was
over
there
the
murderer
all
day
and
all
night
the
dog
howled
in
the
morning
the
old
woman
brought
her
some
water
in
a
bowl
but
nothing
more
no
soup
no
bread
another
day
went
by
semillante
exhausted
was
sleeping
the
following
day
her
eyes
were
shining
her
hair
on
end
and
she
was
pulling
wildly
at
her
chain
all
this
day
the
old
woman
gave
her
nothing
to
eat
the
beast
furious
was
barking
hoarsely
another
night
went
by
then
at
daybreak
mother
saverini
asked
a
neighbor
for
some
straw
she
took
the
old
rags
which
had
formerly
been
worn
by
her
husband
and
stuffed
them
so
as
to
make
them
look
like
a
human
body
having
planted
a
stick
in
the
ground
in
front
of
semillante
s
kennel
she
tied
to
it
this
dummy
which
seemed
to
be
standing
up
then
she
made
a
head
out
of
some
old
rags
the
dog
surprised
was
watching
this
straw
man
and
was
quiet
although
famished
then
the
old
woman
went
to
the
store
and
bought
a
piece
of
black
sausage
when
she
got
home
she
started
a
fire
in
the
yard
near
the
kennel
and
cooked
the
sausage
semillante
frantic
was
jumping
about
frothing
at
the
mouth
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
food
the
odor
of
which
went
right
to
her
stomach
then
the
mother
made
of
the
smoking
sausage
a
necktie
for
the
dummy
she
tied
it
very
tight
around
the
neck
with
string
and
when
she
had
finished
she
untied
the
dog
with
one
leap
the
beast
jumped
at
the
dummy
s
throat
and
with
her
paws
on
its
shoulders
she
began
to
tear
at
it
she
would
fall
back
with
a
piece
of
food
in
her
mouth
then
would
jump
again
sinking
her
fangs
into
the
string
and
snatching
few
pieces
of
meat
she
would
fall
back
again
and
once
more
spring
forward
she
was
tearing
up
the
face
with
her
teeth
and
the
whole
neck
was
in
tatters
the
old
woman
motionless
and
silent
was
watching
eagerly
then
she
chained
the
beast
up
again
made
her
fast
for
two
more
days
and
began
this
strange
performance
again
for
three
months
she
accustomed
her
to
this
battle
to
this
meal
conquered
by
a
fight
she
no
longer
chained
her
up
but
just
pointed
to
the
dummy
she
had
taught
her
to
tear
him
up
and
to
devour
him
without
even
leaving
any
traces
in
her
throat
then
as
a
reward
she
would
give
her
a
piece
of
sausage
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
man
semillante
would
begin
to
tremble
then
she
would
look
up
to
her
mistress
who
lifting
her
finger
would
cry
go
in
a
shrill
tone
when
she
thought
that
the
proper
time
had
come
the
widow
went
to
confession
and
one
sunday
morning
she
partook
of
communion
with
an
ecstatic
fervor
then
putting
on
men
s
clothes
and
looking
like
an
old
tramp
she
struck
a
bargain
with
a
sardinian
fisherman
who
carried
her
and
her
dog
to
the
other
side
of
the
straits
in
a
bag
she
had
a
large
piece
of
sausage
semillante
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
two
days
the
old
woman
kept
letting
her
smell
the
food
and
whetting
her
appetite
they
got
to
longosardo
the
corsican
woman
walked
with
a
limp
she
went
to
a
baker
s
shop
and
asked
for
nicolas
ravolati
he
had
taken
up
his
old
trade
that
of
carpenter
he
was
working
alone
at
the
back
of
his
store
the
old
woman
opened
the
door
and
called
hallo
nicolas
he
turned
around
then
releasing
her
dog
she
cried
go
go
eat
him
up
eat
him
up
the
maddened
animal
sprang
for
his
throat
the
man
stretched
out
his
arms
clasped
the
dog
and
rolled
to
the
ground
for
a
few
seconds
he
squirmed
beating
the
ground
with
his
feet
then
he
stopped
moving
while
semillante
dug
her
fangs
into
his
throat
and
tore
it
to
ribbons
two
neighbors
seated
before
their
door
remembered
perfectly
having
seen
an
old
beggar
come
out
with
a
thin
black
dog
which
was
eating
something
that
its
master
was
giving
him
at
nightfall
the
old
woman
was
at
home
again
she
slept
well
that
night
when
henry
wadsworth
longfellow
the
poet
was
a
boy
he
lived
in
portland
maine
in
those
days
portland
did
much
trading
with
the
west
indies
and
henry
and
his
boy
friends
liked
to
stay
down
at
the
wharves
when
the
portland
vessels
came
in
it
was
sport
to
watch
the
burly
negroes
unload
the
hogsheads
of
molasses
the
barrels
of
sugar
and
the
spices
the
boys
used
to
wish
they
were
sailors
or
captains
so
that
they
could
sail
across
the
water
and
perhaps
have
great
adventures
henry
also
thought
it
would
suit
him
to
be
a
soldier
and
when
he
was
five
years
old
and
there
was
much
talk
about
the
great
war
which
is
called
the
war
of
he
sent
a
letter
to
his
father
who
happened
to
be
away
at
the
time
that
he
had
a
toy
gun
already
and
if
his
father
would
please
buy
him
a
drum
he
would
start
right
off
for
the
battle
field
probably
he
was
not
as
warlike
as
he
fancied
he
was
for
one
fourth
of
july
just
after
that
he
jumped
every
time
a
cannon
went
off
and
begged
his
mother
to
stuff
his
ears
with
cotton
so
that
he
would
not
hear
the
banging
henry
liked
music
and
books
far
better
than
fighting
he
read
a
great
deal
with
his
mother
and
they
took
long
walks
together
for
they
both
loved
flowers
and
birds
twice
every
sunday
henry
went
to
church
with
his
mother
in
the
cold
weather
he
carried
her
foot
stove
for
her
a
funny
little
box
which
held
coals
and
in
the
summer
her
nosegay
because
she
never
went
to
service
after
the
flowers
began
to
bloom
without
a
bunch
of
sweet
smelling
blossoms
this
odd
foot
warmer
can
be
seen
any
time
in
the
old
wadsworth
longfellow
house
in
portland
visitors
from
all
over
the
world
even
from
india
and
turkey
have
wandered
through
this
home
of
the
poet
to
look
at
the
desk
at
which
he
wrote
the
rich
mahogany
chairs
and
the
old
fashioned
mirrors
henry
was
willing
to
do
errands
or
any
tasks
that
his
mother
wished
him
to
do
he
did
not
mind
even
driving
the
cow
to
pasture
for
as
he
walked
along
he
was
usually
making
up
rhymes
and
although
he
had
very
good
lessons
in
school
he
often
scribbled
little
jingles
in
his
copy
book
when
he
was
thirteen
he
told
his
sister
that
he
was
going
to
send
a
poem
to
the
portland
newspaper
he
did
not
tell
any
one
but
her
and
he
only
signed
henry
at
the
end
of
the
poem
so
although
the
editor
printed
it
the
other
school
children
did
not
find
out
for
a
long
time
that
it
was
his
henry
and
his
sister
read
the
printed
verses
until
they
wore
the
newspaper
to
shreds
and
felt
they
had
a
lovely
secret
after
henry
graduated
from
college
his
father
wanted
him
to
be
a
lawyer
like
himself
but
henry
was
sure
he
wanted
to
be
an
author
he
said
don
t
ask
me
to
study
law
father
i
think
i
can
write
books
anyway
if
you
will
let
me
have
my
way
i
will
promise
to
be
famous
at
something
so
his
parents
let
him
travel
through
europe
and
when
he
sent
long
happy
letters
home
telling
about
the
different
things
he
saw
they
were
so
charming
that
all
the
neighbors
wanted
to
borrow
the
letters
and
mr
and
mrs
longfellow
agreed
that
henry
would
probably
be
famous
with
his
pen
when
henry
came
home
again
he
was
chosen
for
a
college
professor
he
was
only
twenty
two
and
it
began
to
look
as
if
the
portland
boy
would
be
a
success
even
if
he
did
not
study
law
the
students
at
harvard
college
loved
young
professor
longfellow
he
was
so
handsome
so
lively
so
exquisitely
neat
in
dress
that
they
were
very
proud
to
introduce
him
to
their
parents
and
best
of
all
he
made
their
lessons
so
interesting
that
they
were
actually
sorry
when
the
class
was
dismissed
he
proved
a
fine
teacher
but
besides
teaching
in
the
college
henry
wrote
poem
after
poem
it
was
not
long
before
his
verses
were
liked
in
other
countries
as
well
as
in
america
french
people
began
to
say
why
we
want
our
children
to
know
henry
wadsworth
longfellow
s
poems
and
spanish
ladies
and
italian
noblemen
declared
they
were
beautiful
finally
so
many
countries
were
asking
for
these
poems
they
were
translated
into
fifteen
languages
longfellow
was
soon
called
the
poet
of
every
land
you
will
think
that
was
the
right
name
for
him
when
you
hear
what
happened
on
a
big
ocean
steamer
once
a
large
party
of
travelers
were
sailing
from
greece
to
france
as
they
sat
talking
one
evening
somebody
praised
the
great
french
poet
victor
hugo
a
lovely
russian
lady
spoke
up
victor
hugo
is
fine
but
no
poet
is
so
well
known
as
the
american
longfellow
i
want
to
go
to
boston
to
see
the
bridge
about
which
he
wrote
then
she
repeated
every
word
of
i
stood
on
the
bridge
at
midnight
upon
that
an
english
captain
just
back
from
the
zulu
war
recited
a
longfellow
poem
a
gray
haired
scotchman
said
another
an
american
remembered
one
a
greek
sang
some
verses
of
longfellow
s
that
had
been
set
to
music
and
when
the
french
captain
of
the
steamer
declaimed
excelsior
there
was
great
handclapping
and
it
showed
that
henry
longfellow
was
indeed
a
favorite
poet
henry
longfellow
liked
cambridge
he
boarded
in
a
fine
old
place
craigie
house
where
general
george
washington
had
once
stayed
and
when
he
was
married
to
a
boston
girl
her
father
gave
them
craigie
house
for
a
wedding
present
longfellow
was
so
happy
as
the
years
went
on
that
he
wrote
better
than
ever
you
will
like
his
hiawatha
which
tells
about
the
indians
his
evangeline
and
the
story
of
myles
standish
do
not
forget
to
read
the
children
s
hour
longfellow
was
never
too
busy
to
play
with
his
children
and
saw
to
it
that
they
were
kept
happy
once
when
he
took
the
three
girls
to
england
charles
dickens
the
great
english
writer
asked
them
to
visit
at
his
grand
place
gads
hill
he
sent
a
wonderful
coach
all
glittering
with
gold
trimmings
and
driven
by
men
in
scarlet
livery
to
the
station
for
them
and
had
a
swiss
chalet
in
his
garden
for
them
to
use
as
a
playhouse
many
great
people
gave
them
dinners
and
parties
but
what
pleased
them
most
of
all
was
the
respect
shown
their
father
one
of
the
daughters
still
lives
in
craigie
house
which
is
often
visited
by
people
who
love
longfellow
s
poems
and
who
wish
to
see
the
rooms
in
which
he
longfellow
could
sell
his
verses
as
fast
as
he
wrote
them
a
new
york
editor
once
paid
longfellow
three
thousand
dollars
for
one
short
poem
and
imagine
how
proud
his
wife
and
children
must
have
been
to
overhear
people
saying
i
wonder
if
mr
longfellow
has
written
anything
lately
if
he
has
i
must
read
it
imagine
how
happy
it
made
his
father
that
he
had
kept
his
word
if
you
will
let
me
have
my
way
i
will
promise
to
be
famous
in
something
and
surely
all
the
americans
who
were
on
that
steamer
and
heard
the
russian
the
greek
and
other
foreigners
reciting
longfellow
s
poems
must
have
been
proud
that
a
man
from
their
own
country
had
won
the
name
of
the
poet
of
every
land
in
a
first
class
carriage
of
a
train
speeding
balkanward
across
the
flat
green
hungarian
plain
two
britons
sat
in
friendly
fitful
converse
they
had
first
foregathered
in
the
cold
grey
dawn
at
the
frontier
line
where
the
presiding
eagle
takes
on
an
extra
head
and
teuton
lands
pass
from
hohenzollern
to
habsburg
keeping
and
where
a
probing
official
beak
requires
to
delve
in
polite
and
perhaps
perfunctory
but
always
tiresome
manner
into
the
baggage
of
sleep
hungry
passengers
after
a
day
s
break
of
their
journey
at
vienna
the
travellers
had
again
foregathered
at
the
trainside
and
paid
one
another
the
compliment
of
settling
instinctively
into
the
same
carriage
the
elder
of
the
two
had
the
appearance
and
manner
of
a
diplomat
in
point
of
fact
he
was
the
well
connected
foster
brother
of
a
wine
business
the
other
was
certainly
a
journalist
neither
man
was
talkative
and
each
was
grateful
to
the
other
for
not
being
talkative
that
is
why
from
time
to
time
they
talked
one
topic
of
conversation
naturally
thrust
itself
forward
in
front
of
all
others
in
vienna
the
previous
day
they
had
learned
of
the
mysterious
vanishing
of
a
world
famous
picture
from
the
walls
of
the
louvre
a
dramatic
disappearance
of
that
sort
is
sure
to
produce
a
crop
of
imitations
said
the
journalist
it
has
had
a
lot
of
anticipations
for
the
matter
of
that
said
the
wine
brother
oh
of
course
there
have
been
thefts
from
the
louvre
before
i
was
thinking
of
the
spiriting
away
of
human
beings
rather
than
pictures
in
particular
i
was
thinking
of
the
case
of
my
aunt
crispina
umberleigh
i
remember
hearing
something
of
the
affair
said
the
journalist
but
i
was
away
from
england
at
the
time
i
never
quite
knew
what
was
supposed
to
have
happened
you
may
hear
what
really
happened
if
you
will
respect
it
as
a
confidence
said
the
wine
merchant
in
the
first
place
i
may
say
that
the
disappearance
of
mrs
umberleigh
was
not
regarded
by
the
family
entirely
as
a
bereavement
my
uncle
edward
umberleigh
was
not
by
any
means
a
weak
kneed
individual
in
fact
in
the
world
of
politics
he
had
to
be
reckoned
with
more
or
less
as
a
strong
man
but
he
was
unmistakably
dominated
by
crispina
indeed
i
never
met
any
human
being
who
was
not
frozen
into
subjection
when
brought
into
prolonged
contact
with
her
some
people
are
born
to
command
crispina
mrs
umberleigh
was
born
to
legislate
codify
administrate
censor
license
ban
execute
and
sit
in
judgement
generally
if
she
was
not
born
with
that
destiny
she
adopted
it
at
an
early
age
from
the
kitchen
regions
upwards
every
one
in
the
household
came
under
her
despotic
sway
and
stayed
there
with
the
submissiveness
of
molluscs
involved
in
a
glacial
epoch
as
a
nephew
on
a
footing
of
only
occasional
visits
she
affected
me
merely
as
an
epidemic
disagreeable
while
it
lasted
but
without
any
permanent
effect
but
her
own
sons
and
daughters
stood
in
mortal
awe
of
her
their
studies
friendships
diet
amusements
religious
observances
and
way
of
doing
their
hair
were
all
regulated
and
ordained
according
to
the
august
lady
s
will
and
pleasure
this
will
help
you
to
understand
the
sensation
of
stupefaction
which
was
caused
in
the
family
when
she
unobtrusively
and
inexplicably
vanished
it
was
as
though
st
paul
s
cathedral
or
the
piccadilly
hotel
had
disappeared
in
the
night
leaving
nothing
but
an
open
space
to
mark
where
it
had
stood
as
far
as
was
known
nothing
was
troubling
her
in
fact
there
was
much
before
her
to
make
life
particularly
well
worth
living
the
youngest
boy
had
come
back
from
school
with
an
unsatisfactory
report
and
she
was
to
have
sat
in
judgement
on
him
the
very
afternoon
of
the
day
she
disappeared
if
it
had
been
he
who
had
vanished
in
a
hurry
one
could
have
supplied
the
motive
then
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
newspaper
correspondence
with
a
rural
dean
in
which
she
had
already
proved
him
guilty
of
heresy
inconsistency
and
unworthy
quibbling
and
no
ordinary
consideration
would
have
induced
her
to
discontinue
the
controversy
of
course
the
matter
was
put
in
the
hands
of
the
police
but
as
far
as
possible
it
was
kept
out
of
the
papers
and
the
generally
accepted
explanation
of
her
withdrawal
from
her
social
circle
was
that
she
had
gone
into
a
nursing
home
and
what
was
the
immediate
effect
on
the
home
circle
asked
the
journalist
all
the
girls
bought
themselves
bicycles
the
feminine
cycling
craze
was
still
in
existence
and
crispina
had
rigidly
vetoed
any
participation
in
it
among
the
members
of
her
household
the
youngest
boy
let
himself
go
to
such
an
extent
during
his
next
term
that
it
had
to
be
his
last
as
far
as
that
particular
establishment
was
concerned
the
elder
boys
propounded
a
theory
that
their
mother
might
be
wandering
somewhere
abroad
and
searched
for
her
assiduously
chiefly
it
must
be
admitted
in
a
class
of
montmartre
resort
where
it
was
extremely
improbable
that
she
would
be
found
and
all
this
while
couldn
t
your
uncle
get
hold
of
the
least
clue
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
received
some
information
though
of
course
i
did
not
know
of
it
at
the
time
he
got
a
message
one
day
telling
him
that
his
wife
had
been
kidnapped
and
smuggled
out
of
the
country
she
was
said
to
be
hidden
away
in
one
of
the
islands
off
the
coast
of
norway
i
think
it
was
in
comfortable
surroundings
and
well
cared
for
and
with
the
information
came
a
demand
for
money
a
lump
sum
of
pounds
was
to
be
paid
yearly
failing
this
she
would
be
immediately
restored
to
her
family
the
journalist
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
them
began
to
laugh
quietly
it
was
certainly
an
inverted
form
of
holding
to
ransom
he
said
if
you
had
known
my
aunt
said
the
wine
merchant
you
would
have
wondered
that
they
didn
t
put
the
figure
higher
i
realise
the
temptation
did
your
uncle
succumb
to
it
well
you
see
he
had
to
think
of
others
as
well
as
himself
for
the
family
to
have
gone
back
into
the
crispina
thraldom
after
having
tasted
the
delights
of
liberty
would
have
been
a
tragedy
and
there
were
even
wider
considerations
to
be
taken
into
account
since
his
bereavement
he
had
unconsciously
taken
up
a
far
bolder
and
more
initiatory
line
in
public
affairs
and
his
popularity
and
influence
had
increased
correspondingly
from
being
merely
a
strong
man
in
the
political
world
he
began
to
be
spoken
of
as
the
strong
man
all
this
he
knew
would
be
jeopardised
if
he
once
more
dropped
into
the
social
position
of
the
husband
of
mrs
umberleigh
he
was
a
rich
man
and
the
pounds
a
year
though
not
exactly
a
fleabite
did
not
seem
an
extravagant
price
to
pay
for
the
boarding
out
of
crispina
of
course
he
had
severe
qualms
of
conscience
about
the
arrangement
later
on
when
he
took
me
into
his
confidence
he
told
me
that
in
paying
the
ransom
or
hush
money
as
i
should
have
called
it
he
was
partly
influenced
by
the
fear
that
if
he
refused
it
the
kidnappers
might
have
vented
their
rage
and
disappointment
on
their
captive
it
was
better
he
said
to
think
of
her
being
well
cared
for
as
a
highly
valued
paying
guest
in
one
of
the
lofoden
islands
than
to
have
her
struggling
miserably
home
in
a
maimed
and
mutilated
condition
anyway
he
paid
the
yearly
instalment
as
punctually
as
one
pays
a
fire
insurance
and
with
equal
promptitude
there
would
come
an
acknowledgment
of
the
money
and
a
brief
statement
to
the
effect
that
crispina
was
in
good
health
and
fairly
cheerful
spirits
one
report
even
mentioned
that
she
was
busying
herself
with
a
scheme
for
proposed
reforms
in
church
management
to
be
pressed
on
the
local
pastorate
another
spoke
of
a
rheumatic
attack
and
a
journey
to
a
cure
on
the
mainland
and
on
that
occasion
an
additional
eighty
pounds
was
demanded
and
conceded
of
course
it
was
to
the
interest
of
the
kidnappers
to
keep
their
charge
in
good
health
but
the
secrecy
with
which
they
managed
to
shroud
their
arrangements
argued
a
really
wonderful
organisation
if
my
uncle
was
paying
a
rather
high
price
at
least
he
could
console
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
was
paying
specialists
fees
meanwhile
had
the
police
given
up
all
attempts
to
track
the
missing
lady
asked
the
journalist
not
entirely
they
came
to
my
uncle
from
time
to
time
to
report
on
clues
which
they
thought
might
yield
some
elucidation
as
to
her
fate
or
whereabouts
but
i
think
they
had
their
suspicions
that
he
was
possessed
of
more
information
than
he
had
put
at
their
disposal
and
then
after
a
disappearance
of
more
than
eight
years
crispina
returned
with
dramatic
suddenness
to
the
home
she
had
left
so
mysteriously
she
had
given
her
captors
the
slip
she
had
never
been
captured
her
wandering
away
had
been
caused
by
a
sudden
and
complete
loss
of
memory
she
usually
dressed
rather
in
the
style
of
a
superior
kind
of
charwoman
and
it
was
not
so
very
surprising
that
she
should
have
imagined
that
she
was
one
and
still
less
that
people
should
accept
her
statement
and
help
her
to
get
work
she
had
wandered
as
far
afield
as
birmingham
and
found
fairly
steady
employment
there
her
energy
and
enthusiasm
in
putting
people
s
rooms
in
order
counterbalancing
her
obstinate
and
domineering
characteristics
it
was
the
shock
of
being
patronisingly
addressed
as
my
good
woman
by
a
curate
who
was
disputing
with
her
where
the
stove
should
be
placed
in
a
parish
concert
hall
that
led
to
the
sudden
restoration
of
her
memory
i
think
you
forget
who
you
are
speaking
to
she
observed
crushingly
which
was
rather
unduly
severe
considering
she
had
only
just
remembered
it
herself
but
exclaimed
the
journalist
the
lofoden
island
people
who
had
they
got
hold
of
a
purely
mythical
prisoner
it
was
an
attempt
in
the
first
place
by
some
one
who
knew
something
of
the
domestic
situation
probably
a
discharged
valet
to
bluff
a
lump
sum
out
of
edward
umberleigh
before
the
missing
woman
turned
up
the
subsequent
yearly
instalments
were
an
unlooked
for
increment
to
the
original
haul
crispina
found
that
the
eight
years
interregnum
had
materially
weakened
her
ascendancy
over
her
now
grown
up
offspring
her
husband
however
never
accomplished
anything
great
in
the
political
world
after
her
return
the
strain
of
trying
to
account
satisfactorily
for
an
unspecified
expenditure
of
sixteen
thousand
pounds
spread
over
eight
years
sufficiently
occupied
his
mental
energies
here
is
belgrad
and
another
custom
house
once
upon
a
time
a
good
many
years
ago
there
was
a
traveller
and
he
set
out
upon
a
journey
it
was
a
magic
journey
and
was
to
seem
very
long
when
he
began
it
and
very
short
when
he
got
half
way
through
he
travelled
along
a
rather
dark
path
for
some
little
time
without
meeting
anything
until
at
last
he
came
to
a
beautiful
child
so
he
said
to
the
child
what
do
you
do
here
and
the
child
said
i
am
always
at
play
come
and
play
with
me
so
he
played
with
that
child
the
whole
day
long
and
they
were
very
merry
the
sky
was
so
blue
the
sun
was
so
bright
the
water
was
so
sparkling
the
leaves
were
so
green
the
flowers
were
so
lovely
and
they
heard
such
singing
birds
and
saw
so
many
butterflies
that
everything
was
beautiful
this
was
in
fine
weather
when
it
rained
they
loved
to
watch
the
falling
drops
and
to
smell
the
fresh
scents
when
it
blew
it
was
delightful
to
listen
to
the
wind
and
fancy
what
it
said
as
it
came
rushing
from
its
home
where
was
that
they
wondered
whistling
and
howling
driving
the
clouds
before
it
bending
the
trees
rumbling
in
the
chimneys
shaking
the
house
and
making
the
sea
roar
in
fury
but
when
it
snowed
that
was
best
of
all
for
they
liked
nothing
so
well
as
to
look
up
at
the
white
flakes
falling
fast
and
thick
like
down
from
the
breasts
of
millions
of
white
birds
and
to
see
how
smooth
and
deep
the
drift
was
and
to
listen
to
the
hush
upon
the
paths
and
roads
they
had
plenty
of
the
finest
toys
in
the
world
and
the
most
astonishing
picture
books
all
about
scimitars
and
slippers
and
turbans
and
dwarfs
and
giants
and
genii
and
fairies
and
blue
beards
and
bean
stalks
and
riches
and
caverns
and
forests
and
valentines
and
orsons
and
all
new
and
all
true
but
one
day
of
a
sudden
the
traveller
lost
the
child
he
called
to
him
over
and
over
again
but
got
no
answer
so
he
went
upon
his
road
and
went
on
for
a
little
while
without
meeting
anything
until
at
last
he
came
to
a
handsome
boy
so
he
said
to
the
boy
what
do
you
do
here
and
the
boy
said
i
am
always
learning
come
and
learn
with
me
so
he
learned
with
that
boy
about
jupiter
and
juno
and
the
greeks
and
the
romans
and
i
don
t
know
what
and
learned
more
than
i
could
tell
or
he
either
for
he
soon
forgot
a
great
deal
of
it
but
they
were
not
always
learning
they
had
the
merriest
games
that
ever
were
played
they
rowed
upon
the
river
in
summer
and
skated
on
the
ice
in
winter
they
were
active
afoot
and
active
on
horseback
at
cricket
and
all
games
at
ball
at
prisoner
s
base
hare
and
hounds
follow
my
leader
and
more
sports
than
i
can
think
of
nobody
could
beat
them
they
had
holidays
too
and
twelfth
cakes
and
parties
where
they
danced
till
midnight
and
real
theatres
where
they
saw
palaces
of
real
gold
and
silver
rise
out
of
the
real
earth
and
saw
all
the
wonders
of
the
world
at
once
as
to
friends
they
had
such
dear
friends
and
so
many
of
them
that
i
want
the
time
to
reckon
them
up
they
were
all
young
like
the
handsome
boy
and
were
never
to
be
strange
to
one
another
all
their
lives
through
still
one
day
in
the
midst
of
all
these
pleasures
the
traveller
lost
the
boy
as
he
had
lost
the
child
and
after
calling
to
him
in
vain
went
on
upon
his
journey
so
he
went
on
for
a
little
while
without
seeing
anything
until
at
last
he
came
to
a
young
man
so
he
said
to
the
young
man
what
do
you
do
here
and
the
young
man
said
i
am
always
in
love
come
and
love
with
me
so
he
went
away
with
that
young
man
and
presently
they
came
to
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
that
ever
was
seen
just
like
fanny
in
the
corner
there
and
she
had
eyes
like
fanny
and
hair
like
fanny
and
dimples
like
fanny
s
and
she
laughed
and
coloured
just
as
fanny
does
while
i
am
talking
about
her
so
the
young
man
fell
in
love
directly
just
as
somebody
i
won
t
mention
the
first
time
he
came
here
did
with
fanny
well
he
was
teased
sometimes
just
as
somebody
used
to
be
by
fanny
and
they
quarrelled
sometimes
just
as
somebody
and
fanny
used
to
quarrel
and
they
made
it
up
and
sat
in
the
dark
and
wrote
letters
every
day
and
never
were
happy
asunder
and
were
always
looking
out
for
one
another
and
pretending
not
to
and
were
engaged
at
christmas
time
and
sat
close
to
one
another
by
the
fire
and
were
going
to
be
married
very
soon
all
exactly
like
somebody
i
won
t
mention
and
fanny
but
the
traveller
lost
them
one
day
as
he
had
lost
the
rest
of
his
friends
and
after
calling
to
them
to
come
back
which
they
never
did
went
on
upon
his
journey
so
he
went
on
for
a
little
while
without
seeing
anything
until
at
last
he
came
to
a
middle
aged
gentleman
so
he
said
to
the
gentleman
what
are
you
doing
here
and
his
answer
was
i
am
always
busy
come
and
be
busy
with
me
so
he
began
to
be
very
busy
with
that
gentleman
and
they
went
on
through
the
wood
together
the
whole
journey
was
through
a
wood
only
it
had
been
open
and
green
at
first
like
a
wood
in
spring
and
now
began
to
be
thick
and
dark
like
a
wood
in
summer
some
of
the
little
trees
that
had
come
out
earliest
were
even
turning
brown
the
gentleman
was
not
alone
but
had
a
lady
of
about
the
same
age
with
him
who
was
his
wife
and
they
had
children
who
were
with
them
too
so
they
all
went
on
together
through
the
wood
cutting
down
the
trees
and
making
a
path
through
the
branches
and
the
fallen
leaves
and
carrying
burdens
and
working
hard
sometimes
they
came
to
a
long
green
avenue
that
opened
into
deeper
woods
then
they
would
hear
a
very
little
distant
voice
crying
father
father
i
am
another
child
stop
for
me
and
presently
they
would
see
a
very
little
figure
growing
larger
as
it
came
along
running
to
join
them
when
it
came
up
they
all
crowded
round
it
and
kissed
and
welcomed
it
and
then
they
all
went
on
together
sometimes
they
came
to
several
avenues
at
once
and
then
they
all
stood
still
and
one
of
the
children
said
father
i
am
going
to
sea
and
another
said
father
i
am
going
to
india
and
another
father
i
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
where
i
can
and
another
father
i
am
going
to
heaven
so
with
many
tears
at
parting
they
went
solitary
down
those
avenues
each
child
upon
its
way
and
the
child
who
went
to
heaven
rose
into
the
golden
air
and
vanished
whenever
these
partings
happened
the
traveller
looked
at
the
gentleman
and
saw
him
glance
up
at
the
sky
above
the
trees
where
the
day
was
beginning
to
decline
and
the
sunset
to
come
on
he
saw
too
that
his
hair
was
turning
grey
but
they
never
could
rest
long
for
they
had
their
journey
to
perform
and
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
be
always
busy
at
last
there
had
been
so
many
partings
that
there
were
no
children
left
and
only
the
traveller
the
gentleman
and
the
lady
went
upon
their
way
in
company
and
now
the
wood
was
yellow
and
now
brown
and
the
leaves
even
of
the
forest
trees
began
to
fall
so
they
came
to
an
avenue
that
was
darker
than
the
rest
and
were
pressing
forward
on
their
journey
without
looking
down
it
when
the
lady
stopped
my
husband
said
the
lady
i
am
called
they
listened
and
they
heard
a
voice
a
long
way
down
the
avenue
say
mother
mother
it
was
the
voice
of
the
first
child
who
had
said
i
am
going
to
heaven
and
the
father
said
i
pray
not
yet
the
sunset
is
very
near
i
pray
not
yet
but
the
voice
cried
mother
mother
without
minding
him
though
his
hair
was
now
quite
white
and
tears
were
on
his
face
then
the
mother
who
was
already
drawn
into
the
shade
of
the
dark
avenue
and
moving
away
with
her
arms
still
round
his
neck
kissed
him
and
said
my
dearest
i
am
summoned
and
i
go
and
she
was
gone
and
the
traveller
and
he
were
left
alone
together
and
they
went
on
and
on
together
until
they
came
to
very
near
the
end
of
the
wood
so
near
that
they
could
see
the
sunset
shining
red
before
them
through
the
trees
yet
once
more
while
he
broke
his
way
among
the
branches
the
traveller
lost
his
friend
he
called
and
called
but
there
was
no
reply
and
when
he
passed
out
of
the
wood
and
saw
the
peaceful
sun
going
down
upon
a
wide
purple
prospect
he
came
to
an
old
man
sitting
on
a
fallen
tree
so
he
said
to
the
old
man
what
do
you
do
here
and
the
old
man
said
with
a
calm
smile
i
am
always
remembering
come
and
remember
with
me
so
the
traveller
sat
down
by
the
side
of
that
old
man
face
to
face
with
the
serene
sunset
and
all
his
friends
came
softly
back
and
stood
around
him
the
beautiful
child
the
handsome
boy
the
young
man
in
love
the
father
mother
and
children
every
one
of
them
was
there
and
he
had
lost
nothing
so
he
loved
them
all
and
was
kind
and
forbearing
with
them
all
and
was
always
pleased
to
watch
them
all
and
they
all
honoured
and
loved
him
and
i
think
the
traveller
must
be
yourself
dear
grandfather
because
this
is
what
you
do
to
us
and
what
we
do
to
you
sir
lulworth
quayne
was
making
a
leisurely
progress
through
the
zoological
society
s
gardens
in
company
with
his
nephew
recently
returned
from
mexico
the
latter
was
interested
in
comparing
and
contrasting
allied
types
of
animals
occurring
in
the
north
american
and
old
world
fauna
one
of
the
most
remarkable
things
in
the
wanderings
of
species
he
observed
is
the
sudden
impulse
to
trek
and
migrate
that
breaks
out
now
and
again
for
no
apparent
reason
in
communities
of
hitherto
stay
at
home
animals
in
human
affairs
the
same
phenomenon
is
occasionally
noticeable
said
sir
lulworth
perhaps
the
most
striking
instance
of
it
occurred
in
this
country
while
you
were
away
in
the
wilds
of
mexico
i
mean
the
wander
fever
which
suddenly
displayed
itself
in
the
managing
and
editorial
staffs
of
certain
london
newspapers
it
began
with
the
stampede
of
the
entire
staff
of
one
of
our
most
brilliant
and
enterprising
weeklies
to
the
banks
of
the
seine
and
the
heights
of
montmartre
the
migration
was
a
brief
one
but
it
heralded
an
era
of
restlessness
in
the
press
world
which
lent
quite
a
new
meaning
to
the
phrase
newspaper
circulation
other
editorial
staffs
were
not
slow
to
imitate
the
example
that
had
been
set
them
paris
soon
dropped
out
of
fashion
as
being
too
near
home
nurnberg
seville
and
salonica
became
more
favoured
as
planting
out
grounds
for
the
personnel
of
not
only
weekly
but
daily
papers
as
well
the
localities
were
perhaps
not
always
well
chosen
the
fact
of
a
leading
organ
of
evangelical
thought
being
edited
for
two
successive
fortnights
from
trouville
and
monte
carlo
was
generally
admitted
to
have
been
a
mistake
and
even
when
enterprising
and
adventurous
editors
took
themselves
and
their
staffs
further
afield
there
were
some
unavoidable
clashings
for
instance

scrutator

bluff
and
the
damsels
own
paper
all
pitched
on
khartoum
for
the
same
week
it
was
perhaps
a
desire
to
out
distance
all
possible
competition
that
influenced
the
management
of
the
daily
intelligencer
one
of
the
most
solid
and
respected
organs
of
liberal
opinion
in
its
decision
to
transfer
its
offices
for
three
or
four
weeks
from
fleet
street
to
eastern
turkestan
allowing
of
course
a
necessary
margin
of
time
for
the
journey
there
and
back
this
was
in
many
respects
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
press
stampedes
that
were
experienced
at
this
time
there
was
no

principal

so
forth

alluded
to
as

that

things
rather
thoroughly
wasn
t
it
said
the
nephew
well
you
see
said
sir
lulworth
the
migration
idea
was
falling
somewhat
into
disrepute
from
the
half
hearted
manner
in
which
it
was
occasionally
carried
out
you
were
not
impressed
by
the
information
that
such
and
such
a
paper
was
being
edited
and
brought
out
at
lisbon
or
innsbruck

you
chanced
to

editor
lunching
as
usual
at
their
accustomed
restaurants
the
daily
intelligencer
was
determined
to
give
no
loophole
for
cavil
at
the
genuineness
of
its
pilgrimage
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
to
a
certain
extent
the
arrangements
made
for
transmitting
copy
and
carrying
on
the
usual
features
of
the

during
the
long
outward
journey

smoothly
and
well

among
the
best
of
the
recent
contributions
to

trade
literature
while
the
views
on
foreign
policy
enunciated
from
a
roof
in
yarkand
showed
at
least
as
much
grasp
of
the
international
situation
as
those
that
had
germinated
within
half
a
mile
of
downing
street
quite
in
keeping
too
with
the
older
and
better
traditions
of
british
journalism

the
manner
of
the
home

bombast
no
personal
advertisement
no
flamboyant
interviews
even
a
complimentary
luncheon
at
the
voyagers
club
was
courteously
declined
indeed
it
began
to
be
felt
that
the
self
effacement
of
the
returned
pressmen
was
being
carried
to
a
pedantic
length

the
non

staff
who
had
of
course
taken
no
part
in
the
great
trek
found
it
as
impossible
to
get
into
direct
communication
with
the
editor
and
his
satellites
now
that
they
had
returned

had

inaccessible

of
the
paper
sardonically
explained
the
new
aloofness
as
the
yarkand
manner
most
of
the
reporters
and
sub
editors
seemed
to
have
been
dismissed
in
autocratic
fashion
since
their
return
and
new
ones
engaged
by
letter
to
these
the
editor
and
his
immediate
associates
remained
an
unseen
presence
issuing
its
instructions
solely
through
the
medium
of
curt
typewritten
notes
something
mystic
and
tibetan
and
forbidden
had
replaced
the
human
bustle
and
democratic
simplicity
of
pre
migration
days
and
the

encountered

of
high
altitudes
and
eastern
atmosphere
on
minds
and
temperaments
unused
to
such
luxuries
the
yarkand
manner
was
not
popular
and
the
contents
of
the
paper
said
the
nephew
did
they
show
the
influence
of
the
new
style
ah
said
sir
lulworth
that
was
the
exciting
thing
in
home
affairs
social
questions
and
the
ordinary
events
of
the
day
not
much
change
was
noticeable
a
certain
oriental
carelessness
seemed
to
have
crept
into
the
editorial
department
and
perhaps
a
note
of
lassitude
not
unnatural
in
the
work
of
men
who
had
returned
from
what
had
been
a
fairly
arduous
journey
the
aforetime
standard
of
excellence
was
scarcely
maintained
but
at
any
rate
the
general
lines
of
policy
and
outlook
were
not
departed
from
it
was
in
the
realm
of
foreign
affairs
that
a
startling
change
took
place
blunt
forcible
outspoken
articles
appeared
couched
in
language
which
nearly
turned
the
autumn
manoeuvres
of
six
important
powers
into
mobilisations
whatever
else
the
daily
intelligencer
had
learned
in
the
east
it
had
not
acquired
the
art
of
diplomatic
ambiguity
the
man
in
the
street
enjoyed
the
articles
and
bought
the
paper
as
he
had
never
bought
it
before
the
men
in
downing
street
took
a
different
view
the
foreign
secretary
hitherto
accounted
a
rather
reticent
man
became
positively
garrulous
in
the
course
of
perpetually
disavowing
the
sentiments
expressed
in
the
daily
intelligencer
s
leaders
and
then
one
day
the
government
came
to
the
conclusion
that
something
definite
and
drastic
must
be
done
a
deputation
consisting
of
the
prime
minister
the
foreign
secretary
four
leading
financiers
and
a
well
known
nonconformist
divine
made
its
way
to
the
offices
of
the
paper
at
the
door
leading
to
the
editorial
department
the
way
was
barred
by
a
nervous
but
defiant
office
boy
you
can
t
see
the
editor
nor
any
of
the
staff
he
announced
we
insist
on
seeing
the
editor
or
some
responsible
person
said
the
prime
minister
and
the
deputation
forced
its
way
in
the
boy
had
spoken
truly
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
suite
of
rooms
there
was
no
sign
of
human
life
where
is
the
editor
or
the
foreign
editor
or
the
chief
leader
writer
or
anybody
in
answer
to
the
shower
of
questions
the
boy
unlocked
a
drawer
and
produced
a
strange
looking
envelope
which
bore
a
khokand
postmark
and
a
date
of
some
seven
or
eight
months
back
it
contained
a
scrap
of
paper
on
which
was
written
the
following
message
entire
party
captured
by
brigand
tribe
on
homeward
journey
quarter
of
million
demanded
as
ransom
but
would
probably
take
less
inform
government
relations
and
friends
there
followed
the
signatures
of
the
principal
members
of
the
party
and
instructions
as
to
how
and
where
the
money
was
to
be
paid
the
letter
had
been
directed
to
the
office
boy
in
charge
who
had
quietly
suppressed
it
no
one
is
a
hero
to
one
s
own
office
boy
and
he
evidently
considered
that
a
quarter
of
a
million
was
an
unwarrantable
outlay
for
such
a
doubtfully
advantageous
object
as
the
repatriation
of
an
errant
newspaper
staff
so
he
drew
the
editorial
and
other
salaries
forged
what
signatures
were
necessary
engaged
new
reporters
did
what
sub
editing
he
could
and
made
as
much
use
as
possible
of
the
large
accumulation
of
special
articles
that
was
held
in
reserve
for
emergencies
the
articles
on
foreign
affairs
were
entirely
his
own
composition
of
course
the
whole
thing
had
to
be
kept
as
quiet
as
possible
an
interim
staff
pledged
to
secrecy
was
appointed
to
keep
the
paper
going
till
the
pining
captives
could
be
sought
out
ransomed
and
brought
home
in
twos
and
threes
to
escape
notice
and
gradually
things
were
put
back
on
their
old
footing
the
articles
on
foreign
affairs
reverted
to
the
wonted
traditions
of
the
paper
but
interposed
the
nephew
how
on
earth
did
the
boy
account
to
the
relatives
all
those
months
for
the
non
appearance
that
said
sir
lulworth
was
the
most
brilliant
stroke
of
all
to
the
wife
or
nearest
relative
of
each
of
the
missing
men
he
forwarded
a
letter
copying
the
handwriting
of
the
supposed
writer
as
well
as
he
could
and
making
excuses
about
vile
pens
and
ink
in
each
letter
he
told
the
same
story
varying
only
the
locality
to
the
effect
that
the
writer
alone
of
the
whole
party
was
unable
to
tear
himself
away
from
the
wild
liberty
and
allurements
of
eastern
life
and
was
going
to
spend
several
months
roaming
in
some
selected
region
many
of
the
wives
started
off
immediately
in
pursuit
of
their
errant
husbands
and
it
took
the
government
a
considerable
time
and
much
trouble
to
reclaim
them
from
their
fruitless
quests
along
the
banks
of
the
oxus
the
gobi
desert
the
orenburg
steppe
and
other
outlandish
places
one
of
them
i
believe
is
still
lost
somewhere
in
the
tigris
valley
and
the
boy
is
still
in
journalism
he
was
dead
the
head
of
a
high
tribunal
the
upright
magistrate
whose
irreproachable
life
was
a
proverb
in
all
the
courts
of
france
advocates
young
counsellors
judges
had
greeted
him
at
sight
of
his
large
thin
pale
face
lighted
up
by
two
sparkling
deep
set
eyes
bowing
low
in
token
of
respect
he
had
passed
his
life
in
pursuing
crime
and
in
protecting
the
weak
swindlers
and
murderers
had
no
more
redoubtable
enemy
for
he
seemed
to
read
the
most
secret
thoughts
of
their
minds
